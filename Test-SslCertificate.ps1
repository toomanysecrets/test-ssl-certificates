<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Validates an SSL certificate and its private key before installing it on the server.

.DESCRIPTION
    This interactive script checks that the `.crt` certificate and the `.key` file match,
    that the certificate is well-formed, and displays relevant information such as validity dates,
    issuer, subject, and fingerprint. It also allows verifying the chain if an intermediate certificate is included.

.NOTES
    Requires OpenSSL to be installed and accessible from PowerShell.
    > winget install ShiningLight.OpenSSL.Light
    or you can also install:
    > winget install FireDaemon.OpenSSL
    or use pwsh in a WSL session.
